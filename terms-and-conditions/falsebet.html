			<h5>Clarification and Disclaimer About FalseBet</h5>
			<p>FalseBet is a football-based prediction game developed by FZG Apps. While it may be classified as simulated gambling under app store guidelines due to its prediction-based mechanics, it is important to clarify that FalseBet is strictly a game for entertainment purposes and does not involve real money or any form of real-world gambling. The game allows users to predict football match outcomes using in-game virtual points. These points have no real-world value and cannot be exchanged for money or prizes. Any success or winnings within the game are purely virtual and do not reflect real-world outcomes. FalseBet is designed to provide a fun and competitive experience, but it does not promote, encourage, or facilitate real-money gambling or financial transactions of any kind. While the game relies on real-world football matches to determine the outcomes of in-game predictions, all gameplay and rewards are confined to the virtual game environment. The real-world match results are only used to simulate the prediction process and do not create any real-world financial consequences for the user. The developers and operators of FalseBet are not responsible for any real-world actions or decisions influenced by gameplay or success within the app. FalseBet does not recommend or suggest that users engage in any form of real-world gambling based on their in-game experience. Winning or success in the app does not mean a user would have similar success in real-world betting or gambling situations.</p>

			<h5>Purpose and Nature of FalseBet</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Entertainment and Strategic Engagement:</strong> FalseBet is designed to offer football fans a fun and competitive way to test their knowledge and prediction skills. The game creates a casual, strategic environment where users can make predictions and win or lose in-game points without financial risk. All gameplay is based on virtual points or currency, which have no real-world value and cannot be converted to cash or any other form of real-world benefit.</li>
				<li><strong>Strategic Gameplay Elements:</strong> The game provides different virtual values (representing the likelihood of different outcomes) to help users make more strategic predictions. These values are designed to make the gameplay more engaging and encourage users to think critically about their predictions. Success or failure within the game is based entirely on in-game events and mechanics — it has no connection to real-world financial markets or betting platforms.</li>
				<li><strong>Simulated Gambling Classification:</strong> FalseBet may be classified as simulated gambling under app store guidelines because of its prediction-based mechanics. However, the app does not involve real-money wagering or any form of financial risk. The game is entirely virtual and does not simulate real-world betting platforms or financial transactions beyond the context of in-game predictions.</li>
				<li><strong>Use of Real-World Match Results:</strong> While the game relies on real-world football match outcomes to determine the results of in-game predictions, this does not create any financial consequence for the user. The connection to real-world matches is only to provide an authentic and engaging prediction experience — not to simulate real-world betting or gambling. Success or failure within the game is based entirely on the prediction of these real-world outcomes, but the impact remains confined to the virtual game environment.</li>
				<li><strong>Virtual Game Environment:</strong> Predictions are made using virtual points, which are provided within the game. Points earned or lost during gameplay have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for money, goods, or services. The app does not offer any mechanism for converting in-game points or rewards into real-world money or prizes.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>No Real-Money Transactions or Payouts</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>No Financial Commitment:</strong> FalseBet does not require users to deposit money or make financial commitments to participate. The game is free to play, and any optional in-game purchases or rewarded ads are for enhancing the gameplay experience only. Users can engage with the full game experience without spending real money.</li>
				<li><strong>No Real-World Financial Impact:</strong> FalseBet does not offer any real-money payouts or rewards. Winning or losing in the game does not result in any financial gain or loss in the real world. The app is structured to provide a risk-free environment where users can play without financial pressure.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>In-Game Rewards and Ads</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ad-Supported Model:</strong> FalseBet generates revenue through advertisements, including banner ads and rewarded ads. Users may choose to watch rewarded ads to receive in-game benefits, such as additional points or gameplay advantages. These benefits are strictly limited to gameplay and cannot be converted to real-world money or benefits.</li>
				<li><strong>Virtual Nature of Rewards:</strong> In-game rewards, points, or benefits cannot be exchanged for cash or any real-world value. All rewards are limited to in-game use and are part of the virtual experience. The game’s rewards are designed to enhance the strategic aspect of gameplay and do not represent real-world value.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>Users Are Solely Responsible for Their Actions</h5>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>No Influence on Real-World Behavior:</strong> FalseBet is designed strictly for entertainment and strategic engagement. Any success or winnings within the game are based solely on in-game mechanics and do not reflect real-world outcomes. FalseBet does NOT recommend or encourage users to engage in any form of real-world gambling based on their in-game performance.</li>
				<li><strong>No Liability for Real-World Consequences:</strong> Users are entirely responsible for their personal decisions and actions outside the app. The developers and operators of FalseBet are not responsible for any financial loss, damage, or consequence resulting from decisions influenced by gameplay. Success within FalseBet does not translate to success in real-world betting scenarios.</li>
				<li><strong>No Encouragement of Illegal or Risky Behavior:</strong> FalseBet does NOT promote or encourage any form of illegal gambling or risky financial behavior. The app does not provide links to real-world betting platforms or services. FalseBet is a standalone virtual game with no connection to real-world gambling environments.</li>
				<li><strong>Strictly for Entertainment Purposes:</strong> FalseBet is a prediction game, not a gambling platform. Success or failure within the game is purely virtual and does not reflect real-world outcomes. Users should engage with FalseBet solely for entertainment and not as a tool for financial gain or decision-making.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Compliance with Store Policies:</strong> FalseBet adheres to the guidelines and requirements of the Google Play Store for simulated gambling games. The app is clearly labeled according to its classification to provide transparency to users.</li>
				<li><strong>Privacy and Data Protection:</strong> FalseBet prioritizes user privacy and data protection. User data is handled securely in compliance with applicable privacy regulations. No sensitive financial information is collected, stored, or processed by the app.</li>
